  # 60 Words About the Author
author-about:  I am an astrophysicist who works on the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment. My research spans many fields across compact objects. Go to my research or project tab to find out more! Currently, I lead the single pulse pulsar survey with CHIME/FRB, and we've already discovered 111 new pulsars. I am also paving the way for a Long Period Transient and pulsar VLBI working group within CHIME. Please reach out if you would like to collaborate.
