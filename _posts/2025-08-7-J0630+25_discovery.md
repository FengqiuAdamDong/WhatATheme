In this paper, we announce the discovery of a long-period, highly magnetized neutron star. With a period of ~7 minutes, this source has a magnetic field of ~$$10^{15}$$ G!

We were only able to confirm this because it experienced a timing glitch, a rapid decrease in its period. To date, this has only been observed in neutron stars. In the figure above, I place our object, CHIME J0630+25, relative to other neutron stars and long-period transients.
