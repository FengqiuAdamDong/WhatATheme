Here we outline the second set of pulsar discoveries from the largest single-pulse-pulsar survey to date. I lead this project to this day and it has yielded numerous fascinating findings. You can find more information [here!]({{site.baseurl}}{% link project.md %}). 

In this paper, we present 21 new sources, but currently our survey has actually yielded 111 [new pulsars!](https://www.chime-frb.ca/galactic).
