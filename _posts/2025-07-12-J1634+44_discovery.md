This paper details the discovery of a new long-period transient. We found it during our blind CHIME/FRB single-pulse pulsar survey. This strange object has a radio pulse period of about 14 minutes with a distinct secondary period of five times that, at just over an hour. We believe that this source is in a binary system. But what's more is that CHIME/ILT J1634+44 is spinning up! Spin-up has never been documented in LPTs before and could be indicative of interesting physics, including, but not limited to, accretion or gravitational wave radiation.
