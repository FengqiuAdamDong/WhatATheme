In this paper, I used statistical methods to constrain the total pulse count and luminosity function of FRBs. This allowed us to go below the sensitivity limit of our telescope and predict what the expected yield is for any particular source. This paper examines three Rotating Radio Transients, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method through a comparison with predictions from the observations of extremely sensitive telescopes.
