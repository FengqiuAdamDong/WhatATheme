  description: I have been part of the CHIME/FRB Collaboration almost since first light. Currently, I am the CHIME/FRB Project Coordinator and lead essential portions of the live processing pipeline, such as the RFI mitigation.

  description: I am the lead of the CHIME/FRB single pulse pulsar survey, and I also lead the Galactic Working Group within the CHIME/FRB project. This is the largest single pulse pulsar survey to date and has discovered over 100 pulsars. Our survey runs 24/7 in real time. For a conventional telescope, the GBT would need to survey for 700,000 hours a month to complete a similar survey!

  description: With the CHIME/FRB Outriggers, we are leading in field-of-view VLBI observations. We now have 3,300 km baseline outrigger stations capable of measuring precise astrometry for all pulsars in the northern hemisphere. I am the lead for the CHIME/FRB Pulsar VLBI Initiative.
